                                Office 2021 is sold as a one-time purchase, which means you pay a single, up-front cost to get Office apps for one computer. One-time purchases are available for both PCs and Macs. However, there are no upgrade options, which means if you plan to upgrade to the next major release, you'll have to buy it at full price. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Microsoft 365 is a subscription that includes the most collaborative, up-to-date features in one seamless, integrated experience. Microsoft 365 includes the robust Office desktop apps that you’re familiar with, like Word, PowerPoint, and Excel. You also get extra online storage and cloud-connected features that let you collaborate on files in real time. With a subscription, you'll always have the latest features, fixes, and security updates along with ongoing tech support at no extra cost. You can choose to pay for your subscription on a monthly or yearly basis, and the Microsoft 365 Family plan lets you share your subscription with your family for up to 6 people, and use your apps on multiple PCs, Macs, tablets, and phones.

                                No. Apps are tailored to work best on each operating system. The apps available for Mac users and the specific features included may be different from those available for PC users. With Microsoft 365, you can be flexible. With your account, you are not limited to exclusively Mac or exclusively PC, so you can transition across device.

                                Internet access is required to install and activate all the latest releases of apps and services included in all Microsoft 365 subscription plans. Note that if you are an existing subscriber, you do not need to reinstall or purchase another subscription.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                For Microsoft 365 plans, Internet access is also needed to manage your subscription account, for example to install apps on other PCs or to change billing options. Internet access is also required to access documents stored on OneDrive, unless you install the <a href="#;">OneDrive desktop app.</a>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                You should also connect to the Internet regularly to keep your version of Microsoft 365 up to date and to benefit from automatic upgrades. If you do not connect to the internet at least every 31 days, your apps will go into reduced functionality mode, which means that you can view or print your documents but cannot edit the documents or create new ones. To reactivate your apps, simply reconnect to the Internet.

                                You do not need to be connected to the Internet to use Office apps such as Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, because the apps are fully installed on your computer.

                                There are semi decent solutions out there such as found here but they and others do not account for sorting. Perhaps consider placing a second DataGridView below the first DataGridView, hide the row and column headers and use this for your footer or place labels below the main DataGridView and update as needed.

                                I have a related question. My company uses a SharePoint team site, which is also visible in my OneDrive Shared Folders on my windows laptop. I also access this on my iPhone using the OneDrive app. The problem we’ve just discovered is that when I use my windows laptop and save a file in the shared Onedrive, it’s not visible to the team on the SharePoint team site. This problem doesn’t happen though using my iPhone app; if I upload a file to the shared Onedrive on the iPhone it appears on the Team SharePoint no problem. this situation now means I can continue using Onedrive on my phone, but on my windows laptop I absolutely must use SharePoint. I’d prefer to just use OneDrive on my PC, but what doesn’t it also save to the collaborative SharePoint site?

                                1. Install JWT Libraries: In the VisitsApi project, install the necessary JWT libraries using NuGet, such as System.IdentityModel.Tokens.Jwt.
                            <br> 2. Configure JWT: In the Startup.cs file of the VisitsApi project, configure JWT authentication in the ConfigureServices method by adding authentication services and specifying JWT as the default scheme.
                            <br> 3. Generate Tokens: Create a method to generate JWT tokens. This method should take user credentials, validate them, and return a JWT token upon successful validation.
                            <br> 4. Protect API Endpoints: Decorate the API endpoints in the VisitsController with the [Authorize] attribute to ensure that they are secured and can only be accessed with a valid JWT token.
                            <br> 5. Client Side Changes: In the PatientPortal project, modify the Visitsnew controller to include code for obtaining a JWT token from the VisitsApi and attach this token to the HTTP headers for subsequent API requests.
                            <br> 6. Test: Finally, test the secured API endpoints using tools like Postman by including the generated JWT token in the Authorization header.

                            <p>All computers that try to connect to my VM's VPN Window server 2022 gets this error. I don't know much about things like this since I am more of a database developer. I created a new VM VPN server from scratch using the same instructions that worked for me yesterday before the error showed up. Everything was working perfectly then I changed the DNS settings on my router (Changed the range of the IP address pool .100 to .200) I did this because I set my VPN server to assign IP addresses from a static pool of .50 to .99.</p>
                            <p>
                                I tried:
                                Changing my DNS settings back
                                Turning off my firewall on server and client side
                                Uninstalling the WAN mini ports

                                Added AssumeUDPEncapsulationOnSendRule key in the Windows registry
                                Ran Network Adapter troubleshooter and Windows Network Diagnostics with no issues
                                Changed Type of VPN to Point to Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP) from Automatic and checked Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP) and Microsoft CHAP Version 2 (MS-CHAP v2)
                            </p>
                            <p>I am wondering if the issue is on the server side since I tested 2 computer and both show that error and can't connect.</p>

                                I was able to solve my problem. The computers were unable to connect to the VPn due to incorrect DNS settings on the server. On the client machine I went to CMD Prompt ping the host server IP. It said couldn't reach destination host so on the server I went to network sharing center. Clicked on the properties of ethernet then set DNS and IP to config automatically. Then I deleted my Virtual switch and tried adding it back. Got an error saying couldn't add it so I Reset the Network Connection using the “netcfg” command. Once that finished I was able to connect to the VPN!!

                                There are a few ways to send output from an Azure AI model to a Blazor backend. One way is to use a RESTful API. You can deploy the AI model as a web service and then call the web service from your Blazor backend. Another way is to use Azure SignalR. You can create a SignalR hub on your Blazor backend and then connect to the hub from the AI model. Once the AI model is connected to the hub, it can send output to the Blazor backend by calling methods on the hub.

                        <h2>Streamline supplier engagement with the new ESG value chain solution</h2>
                        <div class="text">
                            <p>Solving scope 3 carbon measurement requires a collaborative approach, since up to 90 percent of an average company’s resource footprint occurs in the value chain—upstream or downstream of their own operations.1 Most organizations don’t currently have access to the data they need to do this. Without data, they can’t know the full extent of their carbon footprint, and they won’t know how to fix it. </p>
                            <p>Transparency is consistently a challenge. Organizations need better visibility into the environmental footprint of their entire operations, products, and value chain. They’ll be required to report on not only their own sustainability impact but also that of their value chain partners (any third party with whom you do business or are otherwise invested and from whom you need to collect data). But data is difficult to collect, especially data that comes from suppliers or other partners outside the organization. </p>
                            <p>Digital technologies are helping organizations facilitate greater transparency and accountability through their value chain, from raw materials to product creation to distribution. A data-first approach can help drive efficiency, reduce emissions, and design out waste. </p>
                            <p><a href="#;">Microsoft Cloud for Sustainability</a> solutions help organizations gain more visibility into sustainability activities through their value chain. The new <a href="#;">ESG value chain solution</a> can help organizations increase transparency and collect more reliable and accurate information from suppliers up and down their value chain. </p>
                            <h4>Empowering organizations with a streamlined experience for collecting data from suppliers</h4>
                            <p>Now in preview, the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) value chain solution enables you to gather data directly from your value chain partners and use that data to calculate your scope 3 emissions. You can also gather product carbon footprint (PCF) data directly from your suppliers using this feature. (PCF is the total greenhouse gas protocol (GHG) emissions generated during the lifecycle of a product measured in CO2e). While the initial release is specific to collecting emissions and PCF data, future releases will expand functionality to capture water, waste, and additional ESG data as well.    </p>
                            <p>The ESG value chain solution, a feature in <a href="#;">Microsoft Sustainability Manager</a>, will enable organizations to collect and report more detailed data about sustainability activities from their value chain partners. With this capability, you can create surveys and other customized workflows designed to collect emissions and ESG data needed for reporting and science-based target setting and reductions.  </p>
                            <p>This solution streamlines supplier engagement and is powerful because once the suppliers’ data is reviewed and approved (by the organization surveying its suppliers) in Microsoft Sustainability Manager, it can be fed right into that organization’s calculations and reporting. </p>

                            <p>One of the biggest opportunities here is around investing in and transforming the workforce. And for manufacturing and mobility companies, that means empowering one of the largest employee segments—frontline workers. With the advancements in digital tools and next-generation AI, Microsoft can <a href="#;">transform the workplace</a> in the same way that we are transforming other aspects of the business—by unleashing the power of intelligence. AI is a critical tool for unlocking a data-driven, connected, and collaborative workforce. By augmenting the capabilities of the frontline, AI can help free up workers to focus on higher-value tasks and activities.</p>

                            <h4>Guiding your Microsoft Cloud for Sustainability journey </h4>
                            <p>With increasing global regulations and a push to net-zero, organizations are seeking to accelerate their sustainability progress and business growth. Microsoft Cloud for Sustainability is a comprehensive and extensible solution that brings together a set of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) capabilities from Microsoft Azure, Microsoft 365, Microsoft Dynamics 365, and solutions from our global ecosystem of partners. We recently announced Microsoft Sustainability Manager, a <a href="#;">Microsoft Cloud for Sustainability</a> solution, is being expanded <a href="#;">to give customers fuller visibility</a> into their environmental impact across carbon, water, and waste. New capabilities will help customers create a comprehensive ESG data estate and prepare them to meet new reporting requirements.  </p>
                            <p>As part of the Well-Architected for Industry framework, we have curated context-relevant implementation guidance to support the entire solution development lifecycle starting from design and architecting to operational monitoring. The framework consists of five pillars of architectural excellence including reliability, cost optimization, operational excellence, performance efficiency, and security. Project Managers, Solution Architects, Developers, operational team members, and System Administrators can benefit by applying these pillars to their workloads. </p>
                            <p>The Well-Architected for Industry framework is intended to provide substantial benefits to partners and customers.
